We have produced a range of tutorials on a variety of topics. They are targeted at different audiences depending on the content. 

This page provides a brief summary of the topics covered as well as an indication of the target audience.

## [Baseline tables](baselinetables.qmd)

Baseline tables are included in every paper, yet they are time consuming to produce. This vignette shows some tools to make them a little easier to create.

## [Sample size calculation](SampleSizeCalculation.qmd)

Sample size calculations are also required for virtually every project. As statisticians, we regularly receive questions on the topic. This vignette provides an overview of the topic and some recommendations for information you should bring the next time you need to discuss the sample size calculations with a statistician.

## [Adjusted survival curves](AdjustedSurvivalCurves.qmd)

Survival curves are often depicted in an unadjusted state - i.e. the percentage surviving at a given timepoint, potentially split by a group. Where confounding occurs, unadjusted survival curves can be misleading. The inverse probability weighting method seeks to overcome this problem.

## [Safety reporting in clinical trials](safetyreporting.qmd)

Most clinical trials require safety reporting to authorities. This tutorial gives some information on, primarily, annual safety reporting and introduces an R package for automatically filling out the swissethics annual safety report template.

## Recommendations for compiling database in Excel

This document is intended for anyone planning on compiling data into an Excel sheet. Although such practice does not comply with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP), some researchers still have recourse to it. Doing so without a statistician approving of certain features of the database can lead to problems later on ; during data cleaning, data processing and statistical analyses. For this reason, the present recommendations present the points one must observe in order mitigate as much as possible the problems that are inherent to Excel usage.

## Others

Many other tutorials are available. We notably recommend reading the ones published on the following websites:
